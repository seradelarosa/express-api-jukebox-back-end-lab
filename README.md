# express-api-jukebox-back-end-lab

Requirements
Welcome to the Reactville Jukebox! In this lab, you’ll build the back-end of a collaborative, community-driven jukebox application where anyone can contribute tunes by adding, updating, or deleting music tracks. This lab is designed to give you practice developing a back-end API using Express.

As you develop each feature, you should use Postman to test your API endpoints.

You’ll implement full CRUD operations, allowing users to interact freely with the music database. Let’s dive in and make Reactville a bit more musical!

Technical stack
Node.js and Express: The back-end will be built using Node.js with Express to handle server-side logic and HTTP requests.
MongoDB and Mongoose: Use MongoDB as the database for storing track data, with Mongoose in your Node app to provide schema validation.
Necessary middleware
CORS middleware: Implement CORS middleware to enable cross-origin requests, ensuring the React frontend can interact seamlessly with the Express back-end.
Method Override middleware: Implement Method Override middleware so you’re able to use HTTP verbs such as PUT and DELETE.
express.json() middleware: Implement Express’ built-in express.json() middleware to parse incoming requests with JSON payloads.
API requirements
One model - full CRUD: The application will manage a single model, Track, which will support full CRUD operations.
Asynchronous processing: All routes must utilize async/await to handle asynchronous operations properly.
Error handling: Each route must include try/catch blocks to catch and handle errors effectively.
